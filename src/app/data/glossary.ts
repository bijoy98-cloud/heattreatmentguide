  {
    term: 'Annealing',
    definition: 'A heat treatment process that alters the microstructure of a material to change its mechanical or electrical properties. Typically, in steels, annealing is used to reduce hardness, increase ductility and help eliminate internal stresses.',
  },
  {
    term: 'Quenching',
    definition: 'The rapid cooling of a workpiece in water, oil or air to obtain certain material properties. A type of heat treating, quenching prevents low-temperature processes, such as phase transformations, from occurring.',
  },
  {
    term: 'Tempering',
    definition: 'A process of heat treating, which is used to increase the toughness of iron-based alloys. Tempering is usually performed after hardening, to reduce some of the excess hardness, and is done by heating the metal to some temperature below the critical point for a certain period of time, then allowing it to cool in still air.',
  },
  {
    term: 'Austenite',
    definition: 'A metallic, non-magnetic allotrope of iron or a solid solution of iron with an alloying element. In plain-carbon steel, austenite exists above the critical eutectoid temperature of 1000 K (727 °C).',
  },
  {
    term: 'Martensite',
    definition: 'A very hard form of steel crystalline structure. It is named after German metallurgist Adolf Martens. By analogy the term can also refer to any crystal structure that is formed by diffusionless transformation.',
  },
  {
    term: 'Bainite',
    definition: 'A plate-like microstructure that forms in steels at temperatures of 125–550 °C (depending on alloy content). It is an intermediate product between pearlite and martensite.',
  },
  {
    term: 'Carburizing',
    definition: 'A heat treatment process in which iron or steel absorbs carbon while the metal is heated in the presence of a carbon-bearing material, such as charcoal or carbon monoxide. The intent is to make the metal harder.',
